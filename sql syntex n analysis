---Joins

--Inner Join
---Fetch customers zipcode who made purchase on '2019-04-06'

select a.customer_id , b.customer_id, customer_zip
from `farmers_database.customer` a
inner join 
`farmers_database.customer_purchases` b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id 
where market_date = '2019-04-06'

---Another way using correlated sub-query
select customer_id , customer_zip
from `farmers_database.customer`
where customer_id in 
(select customer_id
from `farmers_database.customer_purchases`
where market_date = '2019-04-06')



---Left Join 
---Sum quantity purchased by each customer 
select a.customer_id , sum(quantity) as total_quantity_purchased 
from `farmers_database.customer` a 
left join 
`farmers_database.customer_purchases` b
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
group by 1 


select a.customer_id , a.customer_first_name, a.customer_zip , b.market_date ,b.product_id , b.quantity
from `farmers_database.customer` a 
left join 
`farmers_database.customer_purchases` b
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
where a.customer_id in (56,55)



---Customers who have deleted their account from the app 
--RIGHT JOIN
select distinct a.customer_id , b.customer_id
from `farmers_database.customer` a 
right join 
`farmers_database.customer_purchases` b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id

---Joins Continued 
---Outer JOIN

--MYSQL : outer join is not supported
--First left join , then right join , then final union 

--Where we want to fetch all the customer who have or haven't made any purchase 

select a.customer_id as cust_tb_cid, b.customer_id as sale_tb_cid , a.customer_zip , b.quantity
from `farmers_database.customer` a 
full outer join 
`farmers_database.customer_purchases` b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
where b.customer_id is null or a.customer_id is null


--With left join : all the customer with sales , (customers with 0 sales have NULL values)
--With Right join : all the customers who made purchase even if they do not exist in customer table (customers who deleted their account)


---Self Joins : Join with the table itself 
---Two different customer id who share same zip code 
select a.customer_id , a.customer_zip , b.customer_id , b.customer_zip
from `farmers_database.customer` a 
join `farmers_database.customer` b 
on a.customer_zip = b.customer_zip and a.customer_id <> b.customer_id


---Cross Joins : Cartesian product join (mxn rows)
select product_category_name , product_name
from `farmers_database.product` , `farmers_database.products_category`
